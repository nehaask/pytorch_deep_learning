# Vision Transformer (ViT) Replication - FoodVision Mini 🍕🥩🍣

This project replicates the original [ViT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), 
*"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"*, 
using PyTorch and applies it to the FoodVision Mini dataset (pizza, steak, sushi).

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` → step-by-step Jupyter notebook replication
- `src/` → modular PyTorch code for data setup, model, training, and utils
- `experiments/` → results, logs, trained models

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vit-foodvision-mini.git
cd vit-foodvision-mini
pip install -r requirements.txt
